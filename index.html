      <p>Welcome to my personal website! Here, you will learn a great deal about myself and my journey through web development. As you can infer, this is my first website and it is developed from scratch. I intend to make this website as enjoyable as possible by including various styles and formats.</p>

      <p>In one week, I have learned how to use git, github, gitlab, and gitbash. Admittedly, I feel like a hacker using gitbash to run commands. Finally, I have command over my computer! I have thoroughly enjoyed learning new material through this program and continue to look forward to following classes.</p>

      <p>Please share your feedback about my website so, I can become a better developer. I prefer to learn through trial and error because I have found that is the best way to learn and test my knowledge. All types of criticism are welcomed.</p>
