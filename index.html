                        Welcome to my personal website! Here, you will learn a great deal about myself and my journey
                        through web development. As you can infer, this is my first website and it is developed from
                        scratch. I intend to make this website as enjoyable as possible by including various styles 
                        and formats.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p2">
                        In one week, I have learned how to use git, github, gitlab, and gitbash. Admittedly, I feel 
                        like a hacker using gitbash to run commands. Finally, I have command over my computer!
                        I have thoroughly enjoyed learning new material through this program and continue to look
                        forward to following classes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p3">
                        Please share your feedback about my website so, I can become a better developer.  I prefer to learn 
                        through trial and error because I have found that is the best way to learn and test my knowledge.
                        All types of criticism are welcomed.
                    </p>
